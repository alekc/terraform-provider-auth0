# auth0_flow (Resource)

Update the actions that are bound (i.e. attached) to a trigger. Once an action is created and deployed, it must be
attached (i.e. bound) to a trigger so that it will be executed as part of a flow.

The order in which the actions are provided will determine the order in which they are executed.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "auth0_action" "myaction" {
  name = "First action"
  trigger {
    id = "post-login"
  }
  code = "exports.onExecutePostLogin = async (event, api) => {};"
  deploy = true
}
resource "auth0_action" "myaction2" {
  name = "Second Action"
  trigger {
    id = "post-login"
  }
  code = "exports.onExecutePostLogin = async (event, api) => {};"
  deploy = true
}
resource "auth0_flow" "bind" {
  trigger_id = "post-login"
  action {
    display_name = "action1"
    id = auth0_action.myaction.id # you can link the action either by id
  }
  action {
    display_name = "action2"
    name = auth0_action.myaction2.name # or by the name
  }
}
```
